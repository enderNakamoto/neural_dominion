## Overeview

A multiplayer nation simulation game inspired by *NationStates*, where players create nations aligned with their political ideals and compete against AI-controlled nations led by historical personalities. Every decision shapes your nation's future, influencing alliances and economic growth. As a PvP experience, nations strive to achieve the highest GDP while forging strategic partnerships with AI-driven nations. 
  
This game serves as an experiment in human-in-the-loop agentic gameplay and autonomous agent-to-agent interactions, where emergent narratives unfold through dynamic decision-making.  

### Example Issue of the Game:  

![alt text](images/image-4.png)

Both human and AI-led nations must navigate complex socio-political and economic dilemmas, shaping their national policies over time. Decisions impact a nation's **political freedom, economic freedom, and civil liberties**, gradually shifting its dominant ideology. As nations react to evolving internal and external pressures, they may transform from capitalist democracies to totalitarian regimesâ€”or vice versa.

Which option will your nation choose?

## Game Flow

1. **Game Creation**
   - Player 1 creates a game
   - Selects nation name and initial ideology
   - Makes decisions on various national issues
   - Receives a unique game ID

2. **Player 2 Joining**
   - Joins using the game ID
   - Creates their own nation
   - Makes national decisions
   
3. **AI Processing**
   - Historical AI leaders make decisions for their nations
   - Each AI personality influences decision-making
   - Nations evolve based on choices

4. **Alliance Formation**
   - AI nations analyze compatibility with human nations
   - Form alliances based on:
     - Economic Freedom alignment
     - Civil Rights compatibility
     - Political Freedom similarity
     - Overall ideology match

5. **Winner Calculations**
   - Higher GDP = 20 points
   - Per Allied AI Nation = 10 Oints
   - Player with highest points win!   

## What does the agents do in the game? (for now)

### The Governor (agents/governor.ts)
An AI agent responsible for nation management and decision-making.

### The Diplomat (agents/diplomat.ts)
An AI agent handling international relations and alliance formation.

![alt text](images/image-8.png)

### The Historian (agents/historian.ts)
An AI agent that chronicles the journey of a nation.

## Ideologies and Metrics

![alt text](images/image-2.png)

Nations are measured on three key metrics:
- **Economic Freedom** (0-100)
- **Civil Rights** (0-100)
- **Political Freedom** (0-100)

These metrics evolve based on decisions and determine the nation's governing ideology, ranging from "Psychotic Dictatorship" to "Anarchy" with 27 possible forms of government.

## How Countries Are Put into Ideological Buckets Using 1-NN 

We use **1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN)**, a simplified KNN, to classify countries into ideological groups based on three freedoms:  

1. **Economic Freedom** (how free the market is)  
2. **Civil Rights** (how much personal freedom people have)  
3. **Political Freedom** (how fair and open the government is)  

Each country is represented as a **point in 3D space**, with coordinates.

## Calculation Steps

### 1. Measure Distance
   - We calculate the **Euclidean distance** between a new country and all known countries:  

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
$$
   
   - This tells us which country is the **most similar** in terms of freedom.

### 2. Find the Nearest Neighbor
   - The country that is **closest** in this 3D space is chosen as the **best match**.

### 3. Assign the Ideological Bucket
   - The new country is placed into the **same bucket** as its nearest neighbor.  



### Example

- A new country has scores **(7, 5, 6)**.  
- We check the distance to all known countries.  
- The closest country is in the "Social Democracy" bucket.  
- So, the new country is classified as a **Social Democracy** too.

## Historical Leaders 

The game features various historical personalities including:
- Genghis Khan (The Mongol Empire)
- Napoleon Bonaparte (Imperial France)
- Alexander the Great (Macedonian Empire)
- Winston Churchill (British Empire)
- Nelson Mandela (New South Africa)
- Margaret Thatcher (Neo-Britain)
- Joseph Stalin (Soviet Union)
- Jawaharlal Nehru (Modern India)

Each leader has unique attributes affecting their decision-making: (`db/personalities.ts`)

### Political Spectrum Distribution

* Authoritarian Leaders (Strong centralized rule, expansionist tendencies)
    * Genghis Khan (Mongol Empire)
    * Napoleon Bonaparte (Imperial France)
    * Alexander the Great (Macedonian Empire)

* Democratic Right Leaders (Free-market, conservative values)
    * Winston Churchill (British Empire)
    * Margaret Thatcher (Neo-Britain)
    
* Democratic Left Leaders (Social justice, state-influenced economies)
    * Nelson Mandela (New South Africa)
    * Jawaharlal Nehru (Modern India)

* Totalitarian Left Leaders (State-controlled economy, authoritarian governance)
  * Joseph Stalin (Soviet Union)

## Smart Contract

We have a straightforward smart contract that logs all human and AI moves within the game state. You can find the contract and its basic test cases in the smart-contract folder.

![alt text](images/image-9.png)

Right now, it is not really decentralized, in the future we will have to put AI agents in TEE to make them verified and have them interact with smart contract.

Simple tests -

The Game State is stored with combination of Smart Contract Storage and Local Storage

## Run Locally

```bash
cd gameplay 
npm install
npm run dev
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to create or join a game.
